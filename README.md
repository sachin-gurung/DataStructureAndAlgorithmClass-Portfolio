## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  The problem that I was trying to solve in this project involved creating software that effectively handled course information for the university advising team. The challenges included efficiently read course data from a file, store it in appropriate data structures, select the right data structure and provide functionalities such as sort and print/display the courses, and search course information.
  
## How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  I approached the problem by carefully reviewing the requirements and taking time to understand the needs of the customer. Then I chose the most suitable data structures that I thought would be good to use here in this project. I used tree data structure here to sort and retrieve course information efficiently. Understanding data structures was very important since it helps me pick the right data structure for the job and this determines the performance and scalability of the program.
  
## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  One problem I encountered while going through the project was that it was case sensitive and whenever I try to search a course number and if I entered upper case, it was not working. I overcame this by transforming both the user input and stored data to lower case before comparison.

## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  I enjoyed working on this project. This project taught me the importance of spending time during planning and designing the software before writing code. By creating pseudocode first, I was able to clearly define the logic and identify potential issues early. It also helped me discover the value of choosing the right data structure to meet the requirements. 

## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I learned to write good readable codes by using clear variable names, consistent indentations and proper comments. I also modularized my code and broke it into smaller functions that will be easy to understand and maintain for the future changes.
